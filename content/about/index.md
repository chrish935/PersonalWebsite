My CV: Need to figure out how to link to CV.

Christopher is currently a doctoral student in the department of Pathology & Microbiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. His current research looks into how stapyloccocal biofilms manage to persist in infected individuals despite posessing a competent immune system. He is mainly interested in the metabolic crosstalk that occurs between host leukocytes and the biofilm.
