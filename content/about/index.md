Christopher is currently a doctoral student in the department of Pathology & Microbiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. His current research looks into how stapyloccocal biofilms manage to persist in infected individuals despite posessing a competent immune system. He is particularly interested in how the biofilm influences leukocytes through metabolic crosstalk.
